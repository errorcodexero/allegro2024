CollectAction
-------------
Arguments:
    none

Logic:
    Move the UpDown motor to the collect position
    Spin the intake rollers
    Spin the feeder rollers

    If note is detected at feeder wheels
    - Set note present flag = true
    - Stop intake rollers
    - Stop feeder rollers
    - Move UpDown to stow position

    If action is canceled   
    - Stop intake rollers
    - Stop feeder rollers
    - Move UpDown to stow position

Questions:
    - Is the shoot position and stow position the same
    - How quickly does the UpDown motor move the arm and what do we do if 
      the action canceled based on this.
